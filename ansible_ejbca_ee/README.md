# ansible_ejbca_ee

An Ansible playbook that installs EJBCA CA, external RA, & external VA. The CA can also be configured as a standalone without deploying external RA/VA.

## Current Ansible plays

### configureDB.yml
---

Use this play to update wildfly to point to a different datasource for failing over the EJBCA database. This play can also failback. Reference the steps in the Quickstart section for using this play.

### deployCa.yml
---
Installs and configures EJBCA with a management, root, & issuing CA.  The stack includes Java 11, Apache HTTPD, Maraia DB, SoftHSM, & Wildfly. The playbook has the ability to set up other HSMs and create [Peer Connections](https://doc.primekey.com/ejbca/ejbca-operations/ejbca-ca-concept-guide/peer-systems) to [RA](https://doc.primekey.com/ejbca/ejbca-operations/ejbca-ra-concept-guide), [VA](https://doc.primekey.com/ejbca/ejbca-introduction/ejbca-architecture/external-ocsp-responders) and [SignServer](https://doc.primekey.com/signserver/signserver-reference/peer-systems).

### deployRa.yml
---
Installs and configures EJBCA as an External RA. The play can configure the protocols when not using the RA variant which does not have protocol configuration using the CLI yet.  The stack includes Java 11, Apache HTTPD, Maraia DB, SoftHSM, & Wildfly.

### deployVa.yml
---
Installs and configures EJBCA as an External Validation Authority. The play configures OCSP signing certificates for the management, Root and Sub CA's.  The stack includes Java 11, Apache HTTPD, Maraia DB, SoftHSM, & Wildfly.

### deployCaAndPostConfig.yml
---
This play is handy for populating an EJBCA instance that is freshly built with no configuration such as EJBCA Cloud. EJBCA must already be built and running for this play. CA hierarchies such as root and sub can be built with the play. Configdump is used to bootstrap EJBCA with certificate profiles, end entity profiles, protocl aliases, key bindings, publishers, services, and the protocol configuration.

### deployCaExtDb.yml
---
This play is the same as deployCA.yml except it doesn't install or configure a database. The database must be setup and ready for EJBCA to connect before using this play.

### deployExtRootCaForSubPart1.yml
---
Installs and configures EJBCA with a management CA. A TLS certificate is created for the Root CA Node and downloaded the Ansible controller.  The stack includes Java 11, Apache HTTPD, Maraia DB, SoftHSM, & Wildfly. The playbook has the ability to set up other HSMs.

### deployExtRootCaForSubPart2.yml
---
Installs and configures EJBCA with a Root CA, imports the ManagementCA, adds Super Admin to the Super Admin role. The stack includes Java 11, Apache HTTPD, Maraia DB, SoftHSM, & Wildfly. The playbook has the ability to set up other HSMs.

### deployExtRootCaForSubPart3.yml
---
Creates a sub CA in EJBCA issuing CA node, downloads the CSR to the Ansible controller.

### deployExtRootCaForSubPart4.yml
---
Uploads a sub CA CSR from the Ansible controller to the EJBCA Root CA node to sign, then downloads the signed certificate to the Ansible controller.

### deployExtRootCaForSubPart5.yml
---
Uploads the signed sub CA certificate to the issuing EJBCA node, imports the certificate, and then does post configuration tasks (Key bindings, peering, publishers, etc).

### deployExtSignCA.yml
---
Creates a sub CA on the Issuing EJBCA node, downloads the CSR to the Ansible controller, Uploads the CSR to the EJBCA Root CA node, signs the CSR, downloads the certificate to the Ansible controller, uploads the certificate to the Issuing EJBCA node, and finally imports the certificate to complete the subordination.

### deployExtSignMgmtCa.yml
---
Installs and configures EJBCA with a ManagementCA that will be subordinated to an external CA. The stack includes Java 11, Apache HTTPD, Maraia DB, SoftHSM, & Wildfly. The playbook has the ability to set up other HSMs.

### deployExtSignMgmtCaPost.yml
---
Imports the signed certificate for the ManagementCA signed by an external CA. Adds administrators to the Super Admin role and creates P12 files on the the EJBCA node. EJBCA protocols are configured to enable/disable which protocols are served by the EJBCA node.

### deployExtSignPolCa.yml
---
Creates a Policy CA in EJBCA issuing CA node, downloads the CSR to the Ansible controller.

### deployExtSignPolCaPost.yml
---
Imports the signed Policy CA certificate for the ManagementCA signed by an external CA.

### deployIssuingCa.yml
---
Creates an issuing CA signed by a Policy CA on the EJBCA node.

### deployPeering.yml
---
Configures peering between EJBCA and RA/VA. This role is not usable and requires an update to leverage the new role structure.

### deployPostCaConfig.yml
---
Handles post configuration tasks (Key bindings, peering, publishers, etc).

## Requirements

- Internet Access (required for downloading Wildfly, JDBC driver, HSM client, etc.)
- Access to a repository containing packages, likely on the internet.
- A recent version of [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).
- A web respository that has the enterprise version of EJBCA (Full, RA & VA builds) to download
- A host from where to run the Ansible playbook
- A host where to install EJBCA on, reachable from the Ansible host using SSH with configured SSH keys for SSH agent based login, and the user with ability to become root using sudo.
- the target host need the configured hostname in DNS or hostsfile for Apache to startup properly, i.e.
```bash
/etc/hosts: 192.168.122.92 ejbca01.solitude.skyrim
```


## Dependencies

This is a self contained playbook.  All the roles in this playbook are needed to sucessfully use this playbook.

## Security

Some software is downloaded when running this playbook. It is your responsibility to ensure that the files downloaded are the correct ones, and that integrity is protected. It is recommended to use an internal repository, with approved files, in your organization if security is of a concern.

## Quick Start

CA - Edit _deployment_info/internal_ca_vars.yml_ and _inventory_ and run:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory deployCa.yml --ask-become-pass
```

External RA - Edit _deployment_info/internal_ra_vars.yml_ and _inventory_ and run:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory deployRa.yml --ask-become-pass
```

External VA - Edit _deployment_info/internal_va_vars.yml_ and _inventory_ and run:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory deployVa.yml --ask-become-pass
```

Create a password file protected with Ansible Vault

```bash
touch deployment_info/custom_enc_ca_vars.yml
ansible-vault create deployment_info/custom_enc_ca_vars.yml
```

Edit the password file to add/remove variables

```bash
ansible-vault edit deployment_info/custom_enc_ca_vars.yml
```

Use the Ansible Vault password file

```bash
ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass -i inventory -e @deployment_info/custom_enc_ca_vars.yml deployCa.yml
```

### Switching the Datasource
---
To use the Database source failover/failback use the following commands:

#### Failover 
---
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory -e failover_wildfly_db=true configureDB.yml
```

#### Failback
---
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory -e failback_wildfly_db=true configureDB.yml 
```

## Example Playbook

This example is taken from `deployCa.yml` and is tested on CentOS 8 with FIPS mode disabled (Latest RedHat/CentOS patches broke FIPS mode with Java for EJBCA clientToolBox sunPKCS11).  The playbook saves the serial number for the Peer Connector certificate that is configured as a keybinding on the CA.  Use the serial numbers in this file called peer_cert_serial_numbers.yml to use in the VA and RA ansible playbooks for configuring the Peering Roles.  The playbook creates a file called peer_cert_serial_numbers.yml for the Peer Connector certificates.  This file is saved to  `~/ansible/ansibleCacheDir` and must be accessible for the VA and RA roles.

```yaml
---

- hosts: primekeyServers
  become: yes
  become_method: sudo
  roles:
    - ansible-hostname
    - ansible-role-mariadb
    - ansible-ejbca-wildfly
    - ansible-ejbca-pkc11-client
    - ansible-ejbca-prep
    - ansible-ejbca-deploy-pki-sample
    - ansible-ejbca-crl-import-export
    - ansible-ejbca-httpd
```

The inventory file should contain the following: `inventory`:

```yaml
[ejbcaCaServers]
ejbca01.solitude.skyrim ansible_host=172.16.170.129

[ejbcaVaServers]
ejbcava01.solitude.skyrim ansible_host=172.16.170.128

[ejbcaRaServers]
ejbcara01.solitude.skyrim ansible_host=172.16.170.142
```

Also see a [full documentation of EJBCA](https://doc.primekey.com/doc) on how to further configure/manage EJBCA.

## Role Variables

There are numerous variables for this playbook. These variables are set in `deployment_info/internal_XX_vars.yml`. Reference the deployment_info vars files for the settings used to deploy.



## Compatibility

This role has been tested on these:

|container|tags|
|---------|----|
|el| 8|


The minimum version of Ansible required is 2.9 but tests have been done to:

- The previous version, on version lower.
- The current version.
- The development version.

## Exceptions

Some variarations of the build matrix do not work. These are the variations and reasons why the build won't work:

| variation                 | reason                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| TBD | TBD |

## Installation Notes

1. Using a CentOS8 VM to install onto, installing python3 from yum makes /usr/bin/python3 available, while Ansible by default looks for /usr/bin/python.

Add the following to the play yml that will be used, e.g. deployCa.yml or deployRa.yml  
```yaml
vars:
    ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
```

2. Also seen on CentOS8 is that Apache enables TLSv1.3 by default, and FireFox does not work with client certificate authentication using TLSv1.3. This results in EJBCA Admin UI being unreachable. The TLS config in Apache in available on the target, after the installation, in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
The setting in question is _SSLProtocol -all +TLSv1.2_ and You can enable this setting in the playbook in the file ./roles/ansible-ejbca-httpd/templates/ssl2.conf.j2.

3. The superadmin keystore, SkyrimSuperAdministrator.p12 file ends up in ~/Desktop in the host where you run the ansible-playbook command.
